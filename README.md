# Rust Road Race

Rust Road Race is a simple 2D racing game written in Rust. The objective is to avoid obstacles for as long as you can. The game is based on the tutorial found [here](https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_engine).


## How to play

To play Rust Road Race, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. Once you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can run the game by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

This will compile and run the game in release mode, which should provide better performance.

Once the game starts, you can use the arrow keys to control your player's movement. Avoid obstacles, such as oil slicks and cones, which will slow you down and damage your car.
